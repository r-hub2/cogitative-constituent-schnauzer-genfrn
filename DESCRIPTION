Description: Triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to study fuzzy logic,
    fuzzy reasoning and approximating, fuzzy regression models, etc.
    This package builds the generating function for triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers based on Souliotis et al. (2022)<doi:10.3390/math10183350>. 
    They proposed a method for the construction of fuzzy numbers via a cumulative distribution function based on the possibility theory.
